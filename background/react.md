# React

This section covers the basics of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html). React operates as the
view in Untangled's MVC architecture, so understanding it's behavior will help tremendously when building your web app's
UI.

## Virtual DOM

### Overview

Firstly, if you are not familiar with the real DOM, [this is an excellent and brief primer](https://css-tricks.com/dom/).

It turns out that rendering the DOM is expensive, because [it was not originally designed for the complex web
apps that we use today](http://tonyfreed.com/blog/what_is_virtual_dom). Thus, large web-apps that frequently modify the
DOM can quickly become sluggish performance-wise.

React was built to minimize DOM modifications, so that the render process is as efficient as possible. Even though
rendering the DOM is an expensive operation, browsers have become exceptionally efficient at interpreting Javascript.
React's virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the DOM stored within Javascript. When you make changes to the virtual DOM,
React executes a diff algorithm to determine exactly what changes have occurred. Then it batches the virtual DOM changes
and applies them to the real DOM, which the browser proceeds to render.

In other words, React minimizes DOM modifications by doing what computer scientists do best â€“ adding another layer of
abstraction. Standard Javascript directly modifies the DOM. React, by contrast, does not want you to modify the DOM.
You modify the virtual DOM instead, and React quickly determines what needs to change and where to make those
changes in the real DOM.

So, by keeping track of desired changes to the DOM within Javascript, and batch applying the fewest changes necessary to
reflect the web app's changing state, the browser renders fewer changes to the DOM and does so less frequently than
repeated calls to the slower DOM manipulation functions.

There are [plenty of resources](#more) that discuss virtual dom in more depth.

### React Elements

React Elements are the building blocks for the virtual DOM. There are two kinds of Elements, DOM Elements and
Component Elements. A DOM Element is a collection of data needed to create a virtual representation of a standard DOM
tag (div, p, table, etc.). A Component Element is a grouping of DOM Elements and other Components that render
the data passed into it through `props`.

Untangled requires that all DOM Elements are rendered within Component Elements. We will cover how to create React
DOM Elements and Components in the [View]() chapter of the introduction. Before we get our hands dirty with building a
working UI, it is important to understand the `props` and `key` properties of React Components, and how they affect
rendering behavior.

## Props and Component Local State

Both are just maps of data that a Component uses to determine what will be rendered in the DOM. A re-render is triggered
when either is changed.

The key difference between the two is that `props` are derived from global app state, while component local state only
exists within the component's virtual DOM instance. Once the component is unmounted from the screen, its component state
is destroyed.

If the UI triggers an action that should persist data even if the component is unmounted, make sure that said data is
saved to the global app-state so that it reappears in `props`. Only use component state for transient data.

If you want a slightly more thorough breakdown of props vs state, [this is a great explainer](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md).

For those who are interested in learning more about React, I recommend looking at:

- [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html), an excellent and concise primer on
how React UIs are intended to be designed.
- [React (Virtual) DOM Terminology](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/glossary.html)
- [React.js Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide](http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/)
is one of the better advanced tutorials that covers React concepts and code. It's a long slog, and it's in written in
JSX rather than ClojureScript, but it may help with understanding more of React's innards.
