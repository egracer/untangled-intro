# Om Next

This section covers the basics of [Om Next](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Quick-Start-%28om.next%29), which
contains significant portions of Untangled's model and controller code.

If you are interested in learning all about Om, see the [additional materials]() section. This tutorial is
about explaining the features of Om that do not explicitly appear in Untangled. It also explains some of the design
philosophy behind Om Next, to help familiarize you with Untangled design patterns.

I also assume that you are either familiar with React, or have read the [React introduction](./react.md).

## Minimizing Mutable State

## Global App State vs. UI Data

## Additional Materials

I have not covered the content in the following materials because I believe you do not need to understand nearly all of
how Om works to be a successful Untangled developer. The parts of Om that you need to understand for Untangled development
are covered in the remainder of the introduction. These materials are provided for those of you who want to get your
hands on the Om framework's implementation.

- [Tony Kay's Om Tutorial](https://github.com/awkay/om-tutorial) is a very popular choice, designed as a project that
you can run on your machine and interact with.
- [Tony Kay's Om Next Overview](https://github.com/awkay/om/wiki/Om-Next-Overview), despite the large warning at the
beginning, is highly accurate and even more thorough.
- [Om/Next: The Reconciler](https://medium.com/@kovasb/om-next-the-reconciler-af26f02a6fb4#.p49wiekag) covers one of
Om's most important components.
